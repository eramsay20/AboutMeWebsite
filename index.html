			Hi! I'm Eric, a Baltimore-based software developer in training! If you've made it to this unregistered site, you're probably eager to learn more about my background... am I right??? Then look no further!</p>
		<p>
		For starters, I grew up in a small town in northern Maine called Fort Fairfield with a population of ~4,000 people. For those less intimately familiar with Maine, its a surprisingly large state! The location marker on the map below shows just how far north Fort Fairfield is! You're basically in Canada! Ever drive along i95 through New York City or around Boston? Well... i95 ENDS about an hour SOUTH of where I grew up (see circled intersection). Talk about living in the sticks!
