			Hi! I'm Eric, a Baltimore area based software developer in training! If you've made it to this unregistered site, you're probably eager to learn more about my background... am I right??? Then look no further!</p>
		<p>
		For starters, I grew up in a small town in northern Maine called Fort Fairfield with a population of ~4,000 people. For those less intimately familiar with Maine, its a surprisingly large state! The location marker on the map below shows just how far north Fort Fairfield is! You're basically in Canada! Ever drive along i95 through New York City or around Boston? Well... i95 ENDS about an hour SOUTH of where I grew up (see circled intersection). Talk about living in the sticks!

		<p> Fortunately I had a family that pushed me into education, despite not having gone to college themselves. After highschool I attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME where I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelors in Economics. </p>

   		<p> It wasn't long after graduating school and working in corporate insurance that I felt an itch to challenge myself and break out of my comfort zone. Who knew the next step of my journey would launch me into high-risk venture capital halfway around the world in Shanghai! </p>

	   <p> In 2015 I joined a venture capital firm called <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a>-- a $550M evergreen fund that invests globally through startup accelerator programs in all sorts of industry verticals. Working in Shanghai, my focus was on mobile tech companies, recruiting and fundraising for the the #1 startup accelerator in Asia, <a href="https://chinaccelerator.com/offerings/">Chinaccelerator!</a> </p>

		<p> Little did I know at the time that the woman next to me (sitting to my right) would one day become my wife! After about 18 months based in Shanghai and Taipei working with dozens of innovative startups, my future bride-to-be accompanied me back to the US. I had grown eager to join a high growth trajectory startup myself -- rather than just invest from afar. My journey brought me to San Francisco and later Seattle, where I grew into a valuations management role with what was once a startup company now called <a href="https://carta.com/">Carta.</a> </p>

		<p> In my two years with the company I participated in its growth from ~130 people worth $78M into an industry-leading Series E round valued at $1.7B and 500+ employees! Needless to say, it was one hell of a journey crunched into a short period, but a rewarding one nonetheless. Carta helped me grow personally, professionally, and introduced me to some of the sharpest minds in tech I've ever met. </p>

	   	<p> But after grinding for years, I found something was missing. After years of travel and demanding jobs that took me around the world, I missed my homebase. I had been away from family for nearly 5 years, prioritizing my career over all else. Having been married a few years with parents and grandparents growing older, my wife and I decided to try and set roots closer to my family who had all relocated to Maryland while I was away. As you can probably imagine, Baltimore's job market didn't offer the same landscape available to me on the West coast, and over the past year I've looked into other career options that have interested me over the years, including real estate investing. But after only a year away from tech, I found I really miss it, and once again have an itch to challenge myself in a new endeavor that will hopefully return me to my roots: becoming a full-stack software engineer!  </p>

	   <p> SO! That's a bit about my journey. I've traveled the world, met many inspiring people, and grown with some of the best mentors I could ask for. I've worked along side entrepreneurs and engineers, getting a taste for the programming life and all the challenges that come with it. I'm ready for the next adventure where I can continually push myself to learn new skills., and am confident a new career in software engineering will to do just that!  </p>
